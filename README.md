## 🚀 Overview  
This repository hosts a practice project focused on data-preprocessing techniques commonly used in preparing datasets for machine-learning models. The workflows follow the steps in the Kaggle notebook _“Data Pre-processing Practice”_ by Mohammed Essam.  
This project is ideal for anyone looking to strengthen their skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modelling.

## 📂 Contents  
- `main.py` – the main Python script executing the preprocessing pipeline.  
- `Data Processing Summary.docx` – a summary document that explains each preprocessing step, rationale, and results.  
- `README.md` – this file (you’re reading it!).  
- (Additional files/folders as added for preprocessing steps, datasets etc.)

## 🧪 What’s Covered  
In this project you’ll find the following preprocessing tasks:  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to inspect missing values, distribution, correlations.  
- Handling missing data (imputation, removal) and outliers.  
- Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding) and transforming text features.  
- Scaling/normalizing numerical features.  
- Feature selection or dimensionality reduction (where applicable).  
- Data splitting into training/testing sets.  
- Clean, well-documented code to make reuse and experimentation easier.

## 🛠 Setup & Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedWalid2321/Task1-Data-Pre-processing-practice.git
